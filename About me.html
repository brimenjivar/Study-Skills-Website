            On the 26th of November 2004 at Orange Walk Northern Regional Hospital there was born 2 wonderful twin babies one named Brian and the other Brianna and that was me. Brianna Menjivar a very nice and intelligent girl born and raised in the beautiful village of  Nuevo San Juan. At the age of 5 i started to attend Nuevo San Juan R.C.School and did 3 year but sadly had to move to San Pablo R.C.School to continue my primary education due to my parents separation. At age of 8 I started at San pablo doing my other 5 years and graduated as a Top 10 student being 3rd in my class. Enrolling into my secundary education i got accepted in both OWTHS and ESTM but I decided to attend ESTM. At my 3rd year in ESTM I decided to throw in my self into the business level and studied Agri business ending up graduating with Honors. At the age of 16 I set my mind to furthering more my education so i started attending Muffle Junior College but just did one semester then I dropped out due to personal reasons Seeing that I was letting myself down and not accompishing what I wanted I started to work at A&R with my mom in order to see how life is, I saw life is very hard without education and i decided to try again but at CEMJC i got enrolled and accepted and started as an August intake student seeing all my stuggles and the hard moment faced i decided to buckle up and now i could say that i am so close to accomplishing what i always desired. Centro Escolar Mexico Junior College has made my tertiary level so excited with all the friends that I was able to make and the engagment in the football team I just love it.
