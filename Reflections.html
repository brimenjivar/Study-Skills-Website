              Enrolling in a study skills class seemed like a good idea at first, since it would help my grades. But the emphasis on incentive surprised me. I learned that my greatest impediment was not a lack of intelligence, but a lack of motivation. Learning about intrinsic and extrinsic motivators helped me figure out "why." I discovered that thriving in my academics was not just about grades, but also about feeding my love for business entrepreneurship. I now establish specific, attainable objectives for myself and reward myself when I achieve them. This increased enthusiasm will transfer into active involvement in class, establishing a study routine that works for me, and viewing setbacks as chances to learn and develop. It is no longer only about taking tests; it is about embarking on a lifelong learning adventure.
           Studying study techniques has been eye-opening, especially when it comes to motivation. I've realized that motivation is more than a transitory sensation; it's an attitude that can be maintained and grown. This lesson has taught me how motivation is closely linked to my goal-setting, self-discipline, and thinking. It's about discovering my deeper reasons to pursue my academic goals and learning how to overcome setbacks along the road. One important thing I've learned is the significance of creating clear, attainable objectives and breaking them down into achievable chores. I've also learned techniques for staying motivated, such as building a supportive atmosphere, searching out good inspirations, and celebrating minor triumphs along the road. 
           Moving forward, I plan to apply these lessons in my classes and everyday life by setting clear goals, staying organized, and maintaining a positive attitude even when faced with challenges.

              Studying the POWER Learning strategy in my study skills class has given me excellent insights into efficient learning methods. POWER is an acronym for Prepare, Organize, Work, Evaluate, and Rethink. Each stage in this strategy is important, since it guided my learning through  organized approach to learning. This topic has taught me the need of comprehensive preparation before beginning any learning work, ensuring that I have all of the essential materials and a clear knowledge of what needs to be done. Organizing my study materials and establishing a favorable learning environment has proved to help me focus and be more productive. 
            The "Work" phase in my study skills class focused on active involvement with the content, using tactics such as summarizing, questioning, and elaborating to increase comprehension. Following that, the "Evaluate" stage pushed me to review my success and find areas for improvement, allowing me to change my strategy as necessary. Finally, the "Rethink" step encouraged my reflection on my learning process, helping me improve my techniques and adapt to new obstacles.
            let's consider a scenario where I have an upcoming exam in a challenging subject like Finance. First, I would prepare by reviewing my notes and textbooks,  to ensure I have a comprehensive understanding of the concepts. Next, I would organize my study materials, creating a dedicated study space free from distractions for example let's say i chose the kitchen. During the "Work" phase, I would actively engage with the material by practicing problems, for examples I would practice solving for analysis ratios for say, and teaching the concepts to myself. As I progress, I would evaluate my understanding by testing myself with practice quizzes and reviewing my performance. Finally, in the "Rethink" phase, I would reflect on my study sessions, identifying any areas where I struggled. By following the POWER Learning method in this scenario, I can approach my exam with confidence, knowing that I've employed effective study strategies to maximize my learning outcomes.

              <p>The topic that i feel stood out the best for me throught out this study skills course is the topic Self-esteem. Self-esteem is a topic that resonates deeply with me because it's fundamental to my overall well-being and success in life. In my study skills class, delving into the concept of self-esteem has been particularly enlightening. I've learned that self-esteem is not just about feeling good about myself but also about recognizing one's worth, capabilities, and inherent value as a person. Through discussions and exercises, I've realized that self-esteem influences every aspect of my live, from academic performance to relationships and career success. One key lesson I've taken away is the importance of cultivating a positive self-image and practicing self-compassion. Instead of being overly critical of myself or comparing myself to others, I've learned to embrace my strengths and imperfections alike. Moving forward, I plan to apply these insights by prioritizing self-care, setting realistic goals, and surrounding myself with positive influences that uplift and support me. By nurturing my self-esteem, I believe I can approach challenges with resilience, confidence, and a sense of worthiness, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and empowered life. I chose the topic because  because I want to be positive and I feel this self-esteem teaching helps me to generate belief in myself and this have been helping me achieve my goals. </p>
