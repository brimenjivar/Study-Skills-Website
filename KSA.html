      <h2> Activity #1 (Interpersonal Communication Skills)</h2>
    </footer>
            <p>After completing the interpersonal skills self-assessment, I gained valuable insights into my own strengths and areas for improvement in many aspects of interpersonal communication. Overall, my total score indicates that my interpersonal skills are about average in comparison to others. While I have a fundamental knowledge of interpersonal skills, there is still room for improvement and development. First, I rated my listening skills as average. Although I consider myself a good listener, I am aware that there may be some negative behaviors or areas where I may improve, such as completely focusing on the speaker and understanding their point of view without interrupting or formulating my response prematurely. Similarly, my emotional intelligence score was within the average range. Improving my emotional intelligence will not only enhance my interpersonal skills, but it will also result in more satisfying and productive relationships and interactions. In terms of verbal communication, I considered myself average, with room for improvement in clarity, coherence, and effectiveness. I wish to enhance my verbal communication skills by becoming more aware of my word choice, tone, and delivery, especially in situations where clear and persuasive information is required. Finally, my score for group communication fell within the normal range.

      <h2> Activity #2 (Self-control and self-Monitoring Skills)</h2>
    </footer>
           <p>Taking this exam demonstrates that I have a great aptitude and desire to modify my conduct in response to social settings. I tend to tailor my conduct to the situation, exhibiting self-control and critical awareness of the social ramifications of my actions before acting. This capacity to self-monitor and adjust is a healthy and socially appropriate technique to handle different social situations. Others regard people with a high level of self-monitoring and self-control to be more amiable, receptive, and compassionate. They are less prone to participate in impulsive or improper action that might result in negative consequences such as criticism, rejection, or damaged relationships. 
By exhibiting a willingness to change my conduct, I am more likely to get acceptance and cooperation from others in social and professional situations. My ability to negotiate social situations with knowledge and care for others' feelings helps me to foster better connections and a more pleasant social environment. Continue to use my self-management skills to cultivate meaningful connections and positive interactions.
            </p>
